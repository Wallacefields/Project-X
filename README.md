# Arena.io

*A fast-paced, multiplayer 2D battle arena where players fight bosses and each other to upgrade weapons and survive.*

## Gameplay Overview

Arena.io drops players into a chaotic top-down arena where the objective is to grow stronger through combat. Start with a basic pistol and dagger, and evolve your arsenal by defeating bosses or other players. The more kills you get with a weapon, the more it levels up. There’s no time limit — the fight goes on until you're eliminated… or you eliminate everyone else.

When a player dies, their progress resets, and they re-enter the arena with the starter pistol and dagger.

## Core Features

### Player Mechanics

* Control a circular player avatar.
* Move using **WASD** or **arrow keys**.
* Aim and attack using the **mouse**.

### Weapons and Chests

* Start with:

  * A weak **pistol** (ranged).
  * A weak **dagger** (melee).
* All guns have **unlimited ammo**.
* Gun **range is always visible** as a circle around the player.
* Stronger weapons are obtained from **chests** scattered around the arena.
* Chest rarities include:

  * **Common**
  * **Uncommon**
  * **Rare**
  * **Epic**
  * **Legendary**
  * **Mythic**
* Weapons inside chests are **randomized**.
* Chests must be **manually opened**.

### Bosses

* The arena features five levels of bosses, ranked and increasing in strength and rarity:

  1. **Common Bosses**
  2. **Uncommon Bosses**
  3. **Rare Bosses**
  4. **Legendary Bosses** – very difficult
  5. **Mythic Boss** – the "Big Bad Boss," a unique, nearly impossible enemy
* Upon killing a boss, a chest corresponding to that boss’s rank spawns for the player.
* **Mini-bosses** respawn 1 minute after defeat.

### Arena

* An open 2D environment filled with:

  * Randomly spawning **common to epic chests**.
  * Roaming bosses of varying ranks.
  * Other players in real time.
* No fog of war — all players and gun ranges are visible.

## Progression

* Weapons upgrade based on **kill count** with that specific weapon.
* Upgrade paths affect:

  * Damage
  * Fire rate
  * Range (for guns)
* Players upgrade **automatically** by using weapons effectively.
* **Death resets progress** — players must rebuild from scratch after elimination.

## Strategy

* Search the arena for high-rarity chests.
* Hunt lower-ranked bosses early for better loot.
* Use range visibility to avoid incoming attacks.
* Manually open boss chests quickly after fights.
* Prepare for a serious challenge when approaching **Legendary** or the **Mythic Boss**.

## Goal

Become the dominant force in the arena by:

* Upgrading your weapons through kills.
* Opening better chests for randomized powerful gear.
* Defeating ranked bosses for loot and power.
* Eliminating other players to control the battlefield.
* Conquering the **Mythic Boss** for ultimate bragging rights.
